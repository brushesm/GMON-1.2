The source code has been formatted for readability, but is essentially the
original as written, and assembled using MIKRO (from Supersoft), written by
AJ Trott.

The instructions (GMON 1.2.PDF) has been converted (and reformatted) from the
original Easyscript document.

What makes (made?) GMON different from assembler/disassembler/machine code
monitors of the time is that it allowed the user to use a number of the so-
called 'quasi opcodes'.  The interwebs have a number of articles about these.

Enjoy.
